## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
require(igraph)
karate <- graph.famous("Zachary")
wc <- walktrap.community(karate)
(modularity(wc))
(membership(wc))
plot(wc, karate)
```



```{r}
ebet <- edge.betweenness.community(karate)
fastgreed <- fastgreedy.community(karate)
labelprop <- label.propagation.community(karate)
ev <- leading.eigenvector.community(karate)
multilevel <- multilevel.community(karate)
optimal <- optimal.community(karate)
spinglass <- spinglass.community(karate)
walktrap <- walktrap.community(karate)
infomap <- infomap.community(karate)
```


```{r}
membership(ebet)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
